# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is an app I made while learning with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)



### The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- Add books they are reading or plan to read in future
- Remove books
- Change the status of a book to 'read' or 'unread'
- Save their data on local storage
